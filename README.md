HOOD - Human Odometry Outdoor Data Set
--------------------------------------


1. What is it?
--------------
HOOD - Human Odometry Outdoor Data Set is a public collection of labelled
accelerometer and gyroscope data recordings to be used for the design and validation
of Personal Dead Reckoning (PDR) systems. HOOD is specifically designed to address
the following questions:
- which is the optimal sensor placement for a PDR system?
- what are the performances of human odometry algorithms for uncommon motions such
  as crawling and slithering?
- what are the performances of heading estimation algorithms for uncommon motions
  such as crawling and slithering?
- is it possible to design a single, robust and inexpensive PDR system that can
  reliably reconstruct the followed path for different motion types and path
  configurations, based on accelerometer and gyroscope information exclusively?

HOOD is composed of 72 recordings of accelerometer and gyroscope data collected
from one volunteer performing 6 motion types (slow walking, normal walking, running,
slow crawling, fast crawling, slithering) along 3 different path configurations
(straight line, closed loop, zig-zag) with 4 sensor placements (foot, waist, wrist, chest).

An article describing the dataset is currently under submission at ICRA 2015.
